<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

<strong>Content Based Recommendation Service</strong> which suggests songs similar to the one chosen by the user. It has approximately *160,000 songs* in its database and takes about *300ms to generate recommendations*. 

## Following are some core concept on which this project relies on

</br>

* ### Content Based Filtering

Content-based filtering uses item features to recommend other items similar to what the user likes, based on their previous actions or explicit feedback.

<br />

* ### Cosine Similarity

Cosine similarity measures the similarity between two vectors by calculating the cosine of the angle between them. A simple visualization and the formula can be found below.

### Advantage over Collaborative Filtering
<p>
  Recommendation engines that run on collaborative filtering recommend each item (products advertised on your site) based on user actions. The more user actions an item has, the easier it is to tell which user would be interested in it and what other items are similar to it. As time progresses, the system will be able to give more and more accurate recommendations.
</p>
<p>
  This, however, brings a major contradiction and difficulty to classified sites and their recommendation engines. Even though a new song can  actually be the the most relevant one to a user, a recommendation system has far less confidence in recommending them  than it has with older songs, but it’s just simply not a good idea to let songs ads dominate the recommendation process.
</p>

<p>

  Similarly newer users cannot be provided with accurate recommendations until the user has made few choices himself/herself which will tune the recommendation algorithm.
